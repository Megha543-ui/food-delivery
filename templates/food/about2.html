        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h5>Online Food & <span>Delivery</span></h5>
          <p>
            Online food ordering platforms have increased the convenience level of the customers as well as boosted the restaurantsâ€™ sales by creating their strong online presence in the market.<br>
            Online Food Ordering systems partner with local restaurants that offer home delivery and prepare a database of customers and restaurants.<br>
            For every order placed through the website, the restaurant gives a pre-decided commission.<br>
            Restaurants can also get themselves advertised on popular restaurants section on the website homepage for more visibility.<br>
            Our motive is to provide healthy and hygienic food with fast delivery rate....<br>
