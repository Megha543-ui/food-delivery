                    <h4>Cozy Veggie Korma</h4>
                    <p>Cozy Veggie Korma! A boatload of comforting vegetables like potatoes, bell peppers, and green beans, and a creamy golden sauce with onion, garlic, ginger, warming spices. So comforting!<br>
                       The base of this veggie korma is a boatload of comforting vegetables like fork-tender potatoes, bell peppers, and green beans, but the thing that makes it feel like a hug is that creamy golden sauce.<br>
                       We’re giving a gentle sauté to a careful amount of aromatic onion, garlic, ginger, cardamom, coriander, and other spices, and then adding a bit of cream and yogurt to make this the kind of recipe that lands in the perfect exciting-but-gentle flavor zone.<br>
                       It’s the kind of big-flavor-cozy recipe where you can practically finish the entire pan in one sitting.<br>

                    <h4>Basic + Awesome Broccoli Cheese Soup</h4>
                    <p>
                        This Broccoli Cheese Soup is easy, creamy, and a perfect cozy classic. A silky-smooth soup base, little bites of just-right broccoli and carrots, and some sharp creamy cheddar cheese to finish it off.<br>
                        I would like to campaign for you to enter into fall soup season with this cozy classic Broccoli Cheese Soup.<br>
                        It is a hug-in-a-bowl that is not only *easy to make* but honestly puts Panera’s version to shame.<br>
                        Ooooh yes, I said it! Listen, I truly love Panera, but side-by-side with this comforting pot of creaminess gently bubbling away on the stove, with the FRESH broccoli and carrots, and the glorious cheddar cheese that you ate straight off the cutting board shredded by hand, there is no comparing.<br>

                    <h4>Salted Caramel Rice Krispie Bars</h4>
                    <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes an understated dessert, you might need to look elsewhere.<br>
                       These are butter-forward, sugar-forward, and salt-forward.<br>
                       These are not subtle. They are simple, but they are also big, very sweet and salty, obnoxiously extra, and so deliciously life-changing.<br>
                       Salted Caramel Rice Krispie Bars! Perfectly chewy, crispy, caramelly, buttery, soft, and exactly as over-the-top as you need them to be.<br>
                       Extra butter, extra gooey goodness in the form of a quick homemade salted caramel, and extra textural goodness from a pop into the fridge. DIAL IT UP.<br>
                       Rice Krispie Bars usually aren’t refrigerated,so room temp will also work for you and be nice and soft.<br>
                       Salted Caramel Rice Krispie Treats are unlike any rice krispie treats you have ever had.<br>
